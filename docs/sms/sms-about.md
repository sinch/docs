## Overview

We offer a number of different APIs and libraries that make it easy for you to use our SMS services globally, to send and receive messages.

## The different SMS APIs

### REST
The easiest and most feature-rich API we offer. It allows for single messages, scheduled batch sending, message templates and more. You can also use our server-side libraries if you like to work natively in your programming language of choice.

### SMPP
SMPP interfaces for full control and low latency.
