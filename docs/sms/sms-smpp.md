Sinch offers a traditional telecoms protocol for submission of bulk sms. This protocol is called the SMPP Protocol. More information about the general use and availability of the protocol can be found around the web. However, to assist in understanding the Sinch specific implmentation of the SMPP Protocol, we have created the following few pages. 

### SMPP Outbound
You will be able to find all guidance on how to sent messages via the SMPP protocol [here](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/sms-smpp-outbound).

### SMPP Inbound
Questions about your incoming SMPP Events? Visit [this page](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/sms-smpp-inbound) to see the expected values and their meaning.

### SMPP Errorcodes
[This page](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/sms-smpp-error-specification) describes all potential reject and failed status codes that are used by our system.

### SMPP Encoding 
As SMPP has the ability to support various encoding schemes. For a discription of the encoding schemes supported by sinch, please look [here](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/sms-smpp-encoding).
