## Send your first SMS

Learn how to send SMS messages with the Sinch API in a few minutes. In this guide, we show you how to:

1. Create an account and get your free test number (US only)
2. Send your first SMS

### Sign up for a Sinch account

Before you can send your first SMS, you need a [Sinch
account](https://dashboard.sinch.com/signup). (If you are in the United States, you also need a [free test phone number](https://dashboard.sinch.com/numbers/your-numbers/numbers).)

Click on activate

To use the number with the rest API select REST and click **_Get Free number_**.

### Installing Java helper library

If you want to use java, [install our helper library](doc:sms-java-library)

### Send SMS

```java Java
ApiConnection conn =
        ApiConnection.builder()
            .servicePlanId({service_plan_id})
            .token({your token})
            .start()
String [] RECIPIENTS = {"{To Number}"};
MtBatchTextSmsResult batch =
          conn.createBatch(
              SinchSMSApi.batchTextSms()
                  .sender("{your free test number}")
                  .addRecipient(RECIPIENTS)
                  .body("This is a test message!")
                  .build()

```

Before you can execute the code that sends an SMS message, you need to modify it in a few places.

#### Replace the token values

Replace the values `{service_plan_id}`, `{your token}`, `{your free test number}` and `{To number}` with your values, you can find service plan and token in your dashboard. Go to https://dashboard.sinch.com/sms/api/rest and log in. Click on the "show" link to reveal your token.

To find the From-number, click on the service plan id link and scroll to the bottom of the page.

Change the `{To number}` to your phone number.

## Receive SMS via web-hook

The next step is to handle when you send an SMS to your Sinch number.


### Configure Callback URL for your SMS service

Before you implement the server to handle incoming SMS, you need to configure your SMS service to handle callbacks. Head over to https://dashboard.sinch.com/sms/api/rest and click on your service and you should see a section something like below.

![Screen shot of dashboard](images\sms-callback-url.png)

If you just want to look at what we post you can use http://requestbin.net/

Click create and you should see something like this:

![Screen shot of request bin](images\requestbin.png)

Copy bin URL to the callback URL info and click save.

That's it, send an SMS to your Sinch [number](https://dashboard.sinch.com/numbers/your-numbers/numbers)

Refresh your request bin page to see the request data we send on incoming SMS.

### Handle incoming SMS with Node.js

create a new node app and paste this into app.js

```javascript
const url = require("url");
const http = require("http");
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  let data = [];
  req.on("data", (chunk) => {
    data.push(chunk);
  });
  req.on("end", () => {
    console.log(JSON.parse(data));
  });
  res.end();
});
server.listen(3000);
```

Before you can handle incoming traffic to your local server, you need open up a tunnel to your local server, for that you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tunnel. Open a terminal/command prompt and type: `ngrok http 3000`

Copy the https address in your window run app.js in the command prompt 'node app.js'

![requestbin request](images\ngrok.png)

Head over and change the callback URL in the dashboard for your SMS service.

1. In the terminal windows start the app.js `node app.js`
2. Send an SMS to your Sinch Number
3. You should now see the request coming in
