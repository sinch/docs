## Introduction

The REST Messaging API is designed to be a simple and powerful tool for large scale messaging with features such as:

 - Use a convenient HTTP interface.
 - Send a message to more than one recipient in the same request.
 - Send text messages with up to 1600 characters.
 - Organize your frequent recipients into groups.
 - Send messages at a later time with scheduling.
 - Customize your message for each recipient using parameterization.
 - Receive messages from end users with MO support.
 - Automatic default originator selection support for messages without originator.
 - Receive inbound messages and delivery notifications via HTTP or AWS SNS.
