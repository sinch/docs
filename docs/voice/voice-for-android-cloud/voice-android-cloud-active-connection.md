If push notifications are not desired, the alternative is to use `setSupportActiveConnectionInBackground(true)` and then calling `startListeningOnActiveConnection()` to enable incoming calls. Donâ€™t forget to call `stopListeningOnActiveConnection()` when the user is no longer available for calls (for example if the application is no longer active).

>**Important**

>Listening on the active connection in a background service is not guaranteed started from Android 9. Android OS can stop background services at any moment. Use [managed push functionality]() to receive incoming calls from the background or when the application is stopped (but not _force stopped_).
