## Minimum Requirements

We officially support the 3 latest major Android versions. You can try older versions but there are no guarantees it will work as expected.

## Restrictions on User IDs

User IDs **must not** be longer than **255** bytes and **must** only contain URL-safe characters and is restricted to the following character set:

```text
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghjiklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_=
```

> ❗️
>
> Please note how the allowed character set overlaps with the URL-safe base64 alphabet, but
> does __NOT__ allow characters in the __non__-URL-safe alphabet, e.g. `/`
> (forward slash) and `+` (plus sign).

If you really need to use _User IDs_ containing characters outside the
allowed set above, you could consider _base64_-encoding the raw _User
IDs_ using a URL-safe base64 alphabet as described in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5). 

## Encryption Export Regulations

Please check the Summary of U.S. Export Controls Applicable to Commercial Encryption Products and ensure that the application is registered for the Encryption Regulations, if applicable. It can be found under this [link](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/encryption).

## Statistics

The Sinch SDK client uploads statistics to the Sinch servers at the end of a call, a call failure, or a similar event. The statistics are used for the monitoring of network status, call quality, and other aspects regarding the general quality of the service.

Some of the information is not anonymous and may be associated with the User ID call participants.

The statistics upload is done by the client in the background.
