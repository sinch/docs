### Conversation API Facebook Messenger Support <span class="betabadge">Beta</span>

Conversation API supports Facebook Messenger and allows sending messages from Facebook Pages. The page cannot initiate the conversation; it must be started by a contact. To create and configure a Facebook Page and connect it to Conversation API **app**, follow the instructions below:

- Go to <https://developers.facebook.com/> and log in with your personal/developer account.

- Click on **My Apps** in the top right corner and select Pages App and click **Create App**.

- Fill in the display name for your app and contact Email, then click the **Create App** button.

- Once the app is created, you will see a dashboard with various products that you may add to your app. Click **Set Up** button inside a box with **Messenger** title.

- Scroll down to the **Access Tokens** section, and click the **Create New Page** button.

- Provide a page name and category, then click the **Create Page** button.

- Go back to the **Messenger Setup** page. Now click **Add or Remove pages** in the **Access Tokens** section. Select the previously created page and link it to your app (just **Next**, **Done**, **Ok**).

- You should now see a table row in a table in the **Access Tokens** modal. Click on **Generate Token** for that row. Copy this token (from now on referred as **FACEBOOK_PAGE_TOKEN**) and save it somewhere safe. This is the access token that you need to specify when setting up a Conversation API **app**.

- Then you need to configure a Messenger integration for your Conversation API **app**. The easiest way to do that is to use [Sinch Portal](https://dashboard.sinch.com/convapi/overview). Just select your **app** and click on "SET UP CHANNEL" beside the Messenger channel. Alternatively you can use the management API and specify the `channel_credentials` for Facebook Messenger when creating or updating your app. Example channel configuration is given in the snippet below:

```json
{
  "channel_credentials": [
    {
      "channel": "MESSENGER",
      "static_token": {
        "token": "{{FACEBOOK_PAGE_TOKEN}}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "display_name": "App name"
}
```

- Once you have created Conversation API App, go back to Facebook **Messenger Setup** page, find **Webhooks** section (just below **Access Tokens**), click **Add Callback URL** button and fill in with the following data (**remember to put region (eu1 or us1) and your Conversation App ID in the callback url**): 
  
  Callback URL: `https://messenger-adapter.{{REGION}}.conversation-api.prod.sinch.com/adapter/v1/{{CONVERSATION_APP_ID}}/callback`
  
  Verify Token: `5651d9fd-5c33-4d7a-aa37-5e3e151c2a92`
  
- After clicking **Verify and Save**, if no errors occurred, a table in **Webhooks** section will appear, with your **Facebook Page** listed within. Click **Add Subscriptions** button, check all boxes and click **save**.
- Now you need to enable **pages_messaging** for your App. Scroll down to the **App review for Messenger** section and click **Add to submission** on the **pages_messaging** row.
- Scroll down further and you should see a **Current Submissions** section. You will most likely see a little **Additional Information Required** alert notifying you that you need to complete some details before submitting
- Follow the instructions and go to the settings to add the required pieces, which should be:
  - App Icon
  - Privacy Policy URL (for test and development purposes you may use a generator for it)
  - Category
  - Business Use
- This is enough for test and development purposes, you don't have to fill **Details** section nor submit it for review. Now you can send messages anyone that has been granted either the Administrator, Developer or Tester role for your app.
- Add webhook to your Conversation API **app** using [Sinch Portal](https://dashboard.sinch.com/convapi/overview) or the management API. Example snippet for creating webhook programmatically:

```json
{
  "app_id": "{{APP}}",
  "target": "{{WEBHOOK_URL}}",
  "target_type": "HTTP",
  "triggers": [
    "MESSAGE_DELIVERY",
    "EVENT_DELIVERY",
    "MESSAGE_INBOUND",
    "EVENT_INBOUND",
    "CONVERSATION_START",
    "CONVERSATION_STOP",
    "UNSUPPORTED"
  ]
}
```

- And finally, visit your Facebook Page as a user with proper role granted (preferably the one who created the page) and try sending a message to it - remember that a user has to start the conversation. If everything works fine, you should receive two callbacks, one with `conversation_start_notification`:

```json
{
  "app_id": "01E9DQJFPWGZ2T05XTVZAD0BYB",
  "conversation_start_notification": {
    "conversation": {
      "id": "01E9DV2N8C6CK41XFPGQPN0NWE",
      "app_id": "01E9DQJFPWGZ2T05XTVZAD0BYB",
      "contact_id": "01E9DV2N7TYPJ50V0FYC08110D",
      "last_received": "2020-05-28T14:30:48Z",
      "active_channel": "CHANNEL_UNSPECIFIED",
      "active": true,
      "metadata": "",
      "active_channel_senders": []
    }
  }
}
```

- and one with the message you've just sent:

```json
{
  "app_id": "01E9DQJFPWGZ2T05XTVZAD0BYB",
  "accepted_time": "2020-05-28T14:30:47.850538Z",
  "message": {
    "id": "01E9DV2N92BMDD034JZ0AQ0VKB",
    "direction": "TO_APP",
    "contact_message": {
      "text_message": {
        "text": "Hello World"
      }
    },
    "channel": "MESSENGER",
    "conversation_id": "01E9DV2N8C6CK41XFPGQPN0NWE",
    "contact_id": "01E9DV2N7TYPJ50V0FYC08110D",
    "metadata": "",
    "accept_time": "2020-05-28T14:30:47.841429Z"
  }
}
```

- Now, with a conversation created automatically, you can use received **contact_id** to send a response for this user:

```json
{
  "app_id": "{{APP_ID}}",
  "recipient": {
    "contact_id": "{{CONTACT_ID}}"
  },
  "message": {
    "text_message": {
      "text": "Text message from Sinch Conversation API."
    }
  },
  "channel_priority_order": ["MESSENGER"]
}
```

- You should receive callbacks with information that message has been delivered and read. The channel is now configured.

#### Rich Message Support

This section provides detailed information about which rich messages are natively supported by Facebook Messenger channel and what transcoding is applied in other cases.

##### Sending Messages

Here we give a mapping between Conversation API generic message format and the Messenger rendering on mobile devices.

Please note that for the sake of brevity the JSON snippets do not include the **recipient** and **app_id** which are both required when sending a message.

If you want to send messages outside the standard 24h response window you can do that by adding Messenger channel specific properties in your message request.

For more info check out [**Channel Specific Properties**](doc:conversation-channel-properties).
