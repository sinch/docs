## Add an SMS Channel to your Conversations API App <span class="betabadge">Beta</span>

In this section, you will learn how to add an SMS channel to your Sinch Conversations API Application.  You can add your SMS channel one of two ways: either programmatically via Sinch Conversation API or through the [Sinch online portal](https://dashboard.sinch.com).  Before we begin here are a few items you should already have:

1. A text enabled *long code* or a *short code* registered with Sinch.
2. Access to the Sinch dashboard where you manage your long code or short code.
3. An SMS *Service Plan ID* and *Secret* to authorize SMS text message requests.
4. A Conversations *App ID*.
5. A Sinch *Project ID* and associated Key ID and Key Secret.

If you are missing any of items 1-3 above you should begin by registering online at [*Sinch.com*](https://sinch.com).  We'll show you how to create a *New Conversations App*  and get authentication credentials for items 4 and 5.

### Create a New Conversations App

To create a new Conversations App, simply sign in to your [*Sinch Dashboard account*](https://dashboard.sinch.com) and use the menu on the left to access Conversations > Apps.

Click on the *New App* button on the right, "Name" your App, choose an appropriate region for it, and click *Create*.

In your Sinch Dashboard, navigate to Conversations > Apps.  Click on the *"App Name"* you wish to add the SMS Channel to.

Under *Set up channels* find SMS channel and click on *"Set Up Channel"*.

### Fetch Oauth2 Token needed for authentication

Go to the Access Keys page under Settings and create new key by pressing the "New Key" button:

![access keys](../images/dashboard/dashboard_access_keys.png)

Be sure to copy and store in a safe place the Key Secret you will get. You will not be able to retrieve it again once youâ€™ve created the key.

Then use the key id and key secret to obtain an access token:

```shell Curl
curl https://auth.sinch.com/oauth2/token -d grant_type=client_credentials --user <key_id>:<key_secret>
```

Copy the token and use it in the Authorization header of your calls to Sinch Conversations API.

### Send an SMS Message to a Contact

To send an SMS message to a Contact via the Sinch Conversations API App, send an HTTP POST with the following JSON:

```shell Curl
curl --location --request POST 'https://eu.conversation.api.sinch.com/v1beta/projects/{project_id}/messages:send' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <access token>"
-d '{
    "app_id": "{{YOUR_APP_ID}}",
    "recipient": {
        "identified_by": {
            "channel_identities": [
                {
                    "channel": "SMS",
                    "identity": "+15551231212"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "message": {
        "text_message": {
            "text": "Text message from Sinch Conversation API."
        }
    },
}'
```

When sending SMS messages you can use a channel specific property called `SMS_FLASH_MESSAGE`, check out [**Channel Specific Properties**](doc:conversation-channel-properties) for more info.
